### Step 2. Install Beautiful Soup 4
- Windows

### Step 3. Download file
- Create a folder for this module, e.g. *imse785-web-scraping*.
- Download [raw file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwm1024/imse785scraper/master/simple_weather_scraper.py) from Github, and put in the folder.
- Launch terminal/cmd and navigate to the folder.

### Step 4. Use the simple web scraper
(Replace ```python3``` with ```python``` from now on if you are on Windows)

Type ```python3 simple_weather_scraper -h``` to see the usage.

Usage examples:
1. Get weather data for a given 5-digit zip code and date using the ISO 8601 Notation, i.e. YYYY-MM-DD:
  - ```python3 simple_weather_scraper 66506 2016-01-01```
  - Results are generated by scraping the webpage listed in the first line of the output.
1. Get weather data for a given range by specifying the starting date and number of days with the *-d* flag:
  - ```python3 simple_weather_scraper 66506 2016-01-01 -d 5```
  - Command above will show the weather data from Jan 1, 2016 to Jan 5, 2016.
1. Save the results to a CSV file.
  - ```python3 simple_weather_scraper 66506 2016-01-01 -d 5 -o output.csv```
  - Be Careful! The script will ask you confirm if a file with the same name exists, always double-check to make sure that it's ok to overwrite the previous file.
